  Ah, where to begin from. It was a hectic and stressful event but was still enjoyable. It started like every other event. We went to school 4 days before the main event as there were other events. I was able to catch up with my friends who had previously gone for camp before me. 
  
  But then, the night before the main event I fell sick. I was weak and couldn't eat well that I had to save the bread and egg I bought till the next morning. In the end of all these, I partially enjoyed myself but there are things I wished I did or happened differently.

 This was just the worst. I know I was being lazy about it but damm it was really frustrating when I finally decided to be serious about it but thanks be to God I was able to complete it.

  I've heard many people talk about this and most times they complain about it and how it was stressful and all. That wasn't my case. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. 
  
  I was supposed to go for camp last year with my friends but due to my project issues i wasn't able to even though I was posted to a place that I was excited to go to. Due to that issue, I was able to go then and I had to revalidate.
  
  After revalidation, my state of posting change and I was scared because of the news I've been hearing about the state. I was tempted to stay back again but thank God i didn't because I met a lot of wonderful people and had the most fun I have had in the past 2+ decade of my life. I still left the state though 🙂

 So I moved to a totally new state where I knew no one at all though I had the option of going to a state where I had been before and had at least one or two people that I knew there. I wanted to try somewhere new and different.
 
  I don't regret my decision (lies, I do. I wished I could have gone to lagos where I would have gotten a better paying job 😭)
